The annoying thing about Soulseek is that it puts all your downloads into either "complete" and "downloading" folders based on the status. Sometimes the downloads get stuck and results in stale folders. Most people download only one or two tracks, but since it's downloaded at the folder level it results in the user having to fish out the track. 

This script extracts all completed downloads into the "extracted" folder so that you don't need to go fish out each completed track, and instead just load all the extracted songs in one go to the DJ software of your choosing.
